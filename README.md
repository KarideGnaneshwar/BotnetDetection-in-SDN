<h1 align="center">Detecting and Mitigating Botnet Attacks in Software-Defined Networks Using Deep Learning</h1>

<h2>📘 Overview</h2>
<p>
This project focuses on identifying and preventing <strong>botnet attacks</strong> in 
<strong>Software-Defined Networks (SDN)</strong> using <strong>Deep Learning models</strong>.
It improves SDN security by detecting malicious network traffic patterns and automatically 
blocking suspicious flows.

<h2>📂 Dataset</h2>
<p>
This project uses the <strong>CICIDS2017</strong> dataset, a publicly available intrusion 
detection dataset that includes both normal and malicious network traffic such as DDoS, 
PortScan, Botnet, and Infiltration attacks.
</p>

<p>
Due to file size limitations, the dataset is not included in this repository.
