    <h1>🧠 Detecting and Mitigating Botnet Attacks in Software-Defined Networks Using Deep Learning</h1>

    <h2>📘 Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project focuses on identifying and preventing <strong>botnet attacks</strong> in 
        <strong>Software-Defined Networks (SDN)</strong> using <strong>Deep Learning models</strong>.
        It improves SDN security by detecting malicious network traffic patterns and automatically 
        blocking suspicious flows.
    </p>

    <h2>⚙️ Key Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Detect various types of botnet and DDoS attacks in SDN environments.</li>
        <li>Protect the SDN controller from network-level threats.</li>
        <li>Use deep learning techniques for intelligent traffic classification.</li>
        <li>Provide faster and more accurate threat detection and mitigation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧰 Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> Python</li>
        <li><strong>Frameworks:</strong> TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn</li>
        <li><strong>Libraries:</strong> Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib</li>
        <li><strong>Domain:</strong> Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Cybersecurity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📂 Dataset</h2>
    <p>
        This project uses the <strong>CICIDS2017</strong> dataset, a publicly available intrusion 
        detection dataset that includes normal and malicious network traffic such as DDoS, 
        PortScan, Botnet, and Infiltration attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to size limitations, the dataset is not included directly in this project. 
        It can be downloaded from the official source:

    </p>

    <h2>📊 Results (Highlights)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>High detection accuracy for botnet and other attack types.</li>
        <li>Improved security for SDN environments using deep learning-based detection.</li>
        <li>Reduced false positives compared to basic rule-based detection methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧠 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The proposed system enhances the security of Software-Defined Networks by combining 
        SDN architecture with Deep Learning-based intrusion detection. It can be integrated 
        with SDN controllers to provide <strong>real-time detection</strong> and 
        <strong>automatic mitigation</strong> of network attacks, making modern networks 
        more resilient against botnet threats.
